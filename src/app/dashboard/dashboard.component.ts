      I am currently living in Germany.
      I studied a B.Sc. in Engineering at Pontificia Universidad Cat√≥lica de Chile
      which was ranked best university in Latin America according to QS Ranking (2014).
      This program is recognized by ABET as being substantially equivalent to Computer Engineering.
      Later I studied a M.Sc. in Engineering where I Graduated with honors from the same university.
      I have experience working in different projects developing new software solutions.
      I work mainly with .NET, JavaScript, SQL, Python, Ruby, etc.
      I spend my free time travelling and studying German.`
